## 1) Malware 
# - malicious software - is any program or code that is created with the intent to do harm to a computer, network, or server. 
# - Fileless malware does not require an attacker to install any code on a targets system, making it harder to detect.

## 2) Denial of Service (DOS) attacks
# - targeted attack that floods a network with false requests in order to disrupt business operations. Users are unable to perform routine & necesary tasks. 
# - while most DOS attacks do not result in lost data or information and are typically resolved without payment ransom, they cost the organization money, time and additional recources in order to restore critical business operations.

## 3) Phishing 
# - type of cyber attack that uses email, sms, phone, social media, and social engineering techniques to entice a victem to share sensitive information.

## 4) Spoofing
# - is a technique when the cybercriminal disguises themself as a known or trusted source. the adversary is then able to engage with the target and access thier system, with the ultimate goal of stealing information, extorting money, or installing harmful malware.

## 5) Identity-based attacks 
# - Extremely hard to detect. when a valid users credentials have been compromised and an adversary is masquerading as that user, it is often very difficult to differentiate between the user's typical behavior and that of the hacker using traditional security measures and tools.
# - Common identity-based attacks: 
# * Downgrade Attacks) Adversaries take advantage of a systems backward compatibility to force it into less secure modes of operation, such as forcing a user to go into a HTTP version of a website instead of HTTPS.
# * Brute Force) Trial-and-Error method to systematically guess login infor, credentials, and encryption keys --- until they finally guess correctly.
# * Password Spraying) Threat actor using a single commin password against multiple accounts on the same application. this avoids the account lockouts that typically occur when an attacker uses brute force attack method.
