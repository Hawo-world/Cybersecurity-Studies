### RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service)

# • One of the more common AAA protocols
#      - AAA: Authentication, Authorization, Accounting 
# • Supported on a wide variety of platforms and devices 
# • Not just for dial-in

## Centralize authentication for users 
# • Routers, switches, firewalls
# • Server authentication 
# • Remote VPN access
# • 802.1X network access

## RADIUS services available on almost any server operating system

### TACACS -> Terminal Access Controller

# Access-Control System
# • typically associated with CISCO devices
# • Remote autheauthentication protocol
# • Created to control access to dial-up lines to ARPANET

## TACACS+ 

# • the latest version of TACACS 
# • typically associated with CISCO devices
# • More authentication requests and response codes
# • Released as an open standard in 1993 


### Kerberos (Windows)

## Network authentication protocol
# • supports single sign on 
# • No need to re-authenticate to everything
# • Mutual authentication - the client and the server 
# • protects against on-path or replay attacks
## Standard since the 1980s
# - Developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)

## Microsoft starting using kerberos in Windows 2000
# • when it started to get popular
# • based on Kerberos 5.0 open standard
# • Compatable with other operating systems and devices 

## SSO with Kerberos
# Authentication one time
# • lots of backend ticketing
# • cryptographic tickets (like a ticket pass or school ID)
## No constant username and password input 
# - you save time
## Only works with kerberos
# - Not everything is Kerberos-friendly

### Which method to use? 
# Many different ways to communicate to an authentication server 
# - more than a simple log in process

## often determined but what is at hand
# - VPN concentrator can talk to a RADIUS server
## TACACS+
# - probably a Cisco device
## Kerberos
# - probably a Microsoft network


### Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
# something you are, have, know, do, and somewhere 


### What is Authentication? Definition & Examples
# Sudy Notes | Microsoft.com

# Identiication: username
# Authentication; Password (only the user is supposed to know) | token device, biometrics 
# Authorization: system verifies that the user has permission to the system that they're attempting to access.

## why is authentication important?
# Data breach or exfiltration, installation of mlware-ransomware, noncompliance with regional or industry data privacy regulations.
